# vuetify experiment

## Intro
This project was an experiment with [Vue](http://vuejs.org), [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/) and [Vuetifyjs](http://vuetifyjs.com).

The initial goal was develop a client side interface to CRUD listings, events and deals.

The api was mocked using promises and setTimeout to emulate the request delay.

## Conclusion

I almost deleted this project, as it is just a small PoC of what I can achieve with vuetify, but I'll keep it for future reference.

I fell in some pitfalls with vuex, vue-router and the vuetify itself, so I'll keep this as implementation example and, perhaps, a boilerplate for future projects.
